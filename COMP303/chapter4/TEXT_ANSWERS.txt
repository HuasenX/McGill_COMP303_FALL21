1. There is only one concrete state from the life cycle of an Card object. After a Card object is created by the constructor, there is no method
to modify its fields, thus its state will not change.

2. It does not make sense to model the abstract state space of a Java interface because the interface does not has any object and will not store 
any value itself.
